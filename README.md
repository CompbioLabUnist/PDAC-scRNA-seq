**Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals subtype-specific clonal evolution and microenvironmental changes in liver metastasis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and their clinical implications**
 
##
**ABSTRACT**

**Background**: Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and tumor microenvironment (TME) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) play important roles in tumor evolution and patient outcomes. However, the precise characterization of diverse cell populations and their crosstalk associated with PDAC progression and metastasis is still challenging.

**Methods**: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of treatment-na√Øve primary PDAC samples with and without paired liver metastasis samples to understand the interplay between ITH and TME in the PDAC evolution and its clinical associations.

**Results**: scRNA-seq analysis revealed that even a small proportion (~30%) of basal-like malignant ductal cells could lead to poor chemotherapy response and patient survival and that epithelial-mesenchymal transition programs were largely subtype-specific. The clonal homogeneity significantly increased with more prevalent and pronounced copy number gains of oncogenes, such as *KRAS* and *ETV1*, and losses of tumor suppressor genes, such as *SMAD2* and *MAP2K4*, along PDAC progression and metastasis. Moreover, diverse immune cell populations, including naive SELL<sup>hi</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) and activated TIGIT<sup>hi</sup> Tregs, contributed to shaping immunosuppressive TMEs of PDAC through cellular interactions with malignant ductal cells in PDAC evolution. Importantly, the proportion of basal-like ductal cells negatively correlated with that of immunoreactive cell populations, such as cytotoxic T cells, but positively correlated with that of immunosuppressive cell populations, such as Tregs.

**Conclusion**: We uncover that the proportion of basal-like subtype is a determinant for chemotherapy response and patient outcome, and that PDAC clonally evolves with subtype-specific dosage changes of cancer-associated genes by forming immunosuppressive microenvironments in its progression and metastasis.
